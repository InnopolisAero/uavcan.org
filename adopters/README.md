There should be one image file per adopter.
If you want your company to be listed (unlisted), please send us a pull request.

The image should have no margins -- they are controlled by the website design.
The background should be transparent.

The file name shall follow the following format with space-separated components:

    <human-readable-name> <domain-name>.png

For example:

    Zubax Robotics zubax.com.png

where: `Zubax Robotics` -- name; `zubax.com` -- domain name; `.png` -- file extension.
