One image file per adopter.

The image should have no margins -- they are controlled by the website design.

The file name shall follow the following format with space-separated components:

    <human-readable-name> <domain-name>.png

For example:

    Zubax Robotics zubax.com.png

where: `Zubax Robotics` -- name; `zubax.com` -- domain name; `.png` -- file extension.
